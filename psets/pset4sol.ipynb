    "We are \"pulling\" down a mode from the *top* of the gap, and we saw in class (via perturbation theory) the band-edge mode at the *top* of the gap has an $E_z$ field that is *odd* in the $\\varepsilon_1=12$ layer and *even* in the $\\varepsilon_1=1$ layer.\n",

This is exactly what we see in the plot above!\n",

    "The fact that the $\\Delta\\varepsilon_1$ case has a node right in the middle of the defect layer also means that its $|E_z|$ field is smaller in the defect.  From perturbation theory, this means that the $\\Delta\\varepsilon_1$ defect has a *smaller effect* than the $\\Delta\\varepsilon_2$ defect: the $\\Delta\\varepsilon_1$ defect doesn't \"push\" the mode as far into the gap, resulting in the **dramatically weaker confinement** apparent in the plots above."

    "The mode must decay exponentially far from the defect (multiplied by an $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{a}x}$ sign oscillation and the periodic Bloch envelope, of course). From the $E_{z}$ field computed by MPB, extract this asympotic exponential decay rate (i.e. $\\kappa$ if the field decays $\\sim e^{-\\kappa x}$) and plot this rate as a function of $\\omega$, for the first defect mode, as you increase $\\varepsilon_{2}$ as above (vary $\\varepsilon_{2}$ so that $\\omega$ goes from the top of the gap to the bottom).\n",
    "\n",
    "The supercell size $N=100$ from above is more than sufficient for our purposes.  As seen in the first part of the problem, the rapid decay of the modes means that looking at about $x = 10a$ seems like it should give us a good estimate of the decay rate.  (Looking at much larger $x$ than this risks going into the \"noise floor\" of the mode that we saw in the first part.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the estimate $$\\kappa \\approx \\log|E_z(x)/E_z(x+a)|$$ for $x = 5a$.  From our Python `ez` array, we can compute `kappa = math.log(np.abs(ez[x*resolution]/ez[(x+1)*resolution]))` for `x = N/2 + 5`.   This is implemented in the code for the previous part of the problem above."
